# Quiz System

A user can create quizzes and answer quizzes.
Only the creator of the quiz will be allowed to view the scores of each student.
The questions made during the creation of a quiz can be randomly chosen from a
database by specifying maximum marks for the quiz. The user can enter his own
questions into the database as well.

The quiz master can also decide whether to keep the quiz open or restricted.
